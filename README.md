## **Project Workflow**

### üìä **1. Seasonality Analysis**
- **Objective**: Identify seasonal trends in food consumption.
- Analyzed seasonal trends and patterns using time-series decomposition.
- Used statistical methods to extract trends, seasonality, and residual components.

---

### ü§ñ **2. Demand Prediction**
- **Objective**: Build predictive models to estimate purchase quantities.
- Developed supervised machine learning models such as:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- Identified significant factors influencing demand, such as pricing and economic indicators.

---

### üíµ **3. Price Elasticity**
- **Objective**: Assess how price changes affect demand.
- Calculated elasticity coefficients for key food categories.
- Identified inelastic  and elastic food categories to inform pricing strategies.

---

### ‚è≥ **4. Time-Series Forecasting**
- **Objective**: Predict future trends for inventory and procurement planning.
- Employed forecasting models such as:
  - ARIMA
  - SARIMA
  - Exponential Smoothing
- Generated forecasts for the next 6‚Äì12 months.
