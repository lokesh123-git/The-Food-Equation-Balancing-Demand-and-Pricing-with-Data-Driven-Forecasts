---

### 🔗 **Inter-Category Analysis**
- **📌 Objective**: Examine how demand for one category (e.g., milk) correlates with others (e.g., cereal).
- **📊 Rationale**: 
  - Understand interdependencies among categories.
  - Quantify relationships to optimize bundling and cross-promotion strategies.
- **🔍 Potential Applications**:
  - Create **cross-promotional campaigns**.
  - Align inventory of complementary products, reducing stockouts and wastage.

---

### 🎯 **Clustering Food Categories for Trend Analysis**
- **📌 Objective**: Use clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to group food categories with similar purchase behaviors.
- **📊 Rationale**:
