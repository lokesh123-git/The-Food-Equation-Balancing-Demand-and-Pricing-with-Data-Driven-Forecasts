## **Future Directions**

🌟 Leveraging the insights gained from our current models, we propose the following exciting avenues for future research and development:

---

### 🌐 **Exploring More Food Categories**
- **📌 Objective**: Extend the analysis to include a wider range of food categories beyond the top 10.
- **📊 Rationale**: 
  - Broaden the scope to better understand demand trends across diverse product types.
  - Uncover unique patterns in underrepresented categories.
- **🔍 Potential Impact**: A comprehensive understanding of consumer preferences across all major food categories.

---

### 🏙️ **Expanding to More Cities**
- **📌 Objective**: Expand the geographic focus by analyzing additional metropolitan regions.
- **📊 Rationale**: 
  - Identify unique consumption patterns in urban, suburban, and rural areas.
  - Generalize findings for nationwide applications.
- **🌟 Why It Matters**: Enhances the adaptability of demand forecasting models for different demographics.

---

### 🔗 **Inter-Category Analysis**
- **📌 Objective**: Examine how demand for one category (e.g., milk) correlates with others (e.g., cereal).
- **📊 Rationale**: 
  - Understand interdependencies among categories.
  - Quantify relationships to optimize bundling and cross-promotion strategies.
- **🔍 Potential Applications**:
  - Create **cross-promotional campaigns**.
  - Align inventory of complementary products, reducing stockouts and wastage.

---

### 🎯 **Clustering Food Categories for Trend Analysis**
- **📌 Objective**: Use clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to group food categories with similar purchase behaviors.
- **📊 Rationale**: 
  - Identify clusters to simplify category management.
  - Reveal hidden trends for bundled marketing strategies.
- **🔍 Potential Applications**:
  - Inform **shelf arrangement and promotions**.
