# Seasonality Analysis

This notebook investigates seasonal trends and patterns in consumer purchasing behavior for various food categories across 10 metropolitan regions. It leverages time-series decomposition and statistical techniques to derive meaningful insights.

---

## Objective

The goal of the seasonality analysis is to:
- Identify and analyze seasonal trends for high-consumption food categories.
- Explore regional variations in purchasing behavior across metro regions.
- Detect recurring patterns that impact demand.

---

## Methodology

### Data Preparation:
- Input dataset: `metroregion_filtered_data.csv`.
- Preprocessed columns to convert `Year` and `Month` into a single `Date` column.
- Added a `Season` column to classify months into **Winter**, **Spring**, **Summer**, and **Fall**.

### Group Analysis:
- Grouped data by food category (`EFPG_name`), metro region (`Metroregion_name`), and season (`Season`).
- Calculated total weighted purchase quantities (`Purchase_grams_wtd`) for each group.

### Visualizations:
- Generated grouped bar charts to illustrate regional and seasonal purchase variations for selected food categories.
- Highlighted differences in consumption patterns across metro regions and seasons.

### Seasonal Decomposition:
- Applied **Additive Decomposition** using `statsmodels` to break down time-series data into:
  - **Trend**: Long-term movement in data.
  - **Seasonality**: Recurring patterns at regular intervals.
  - **Residual**: Irregular fluctuations after removing trend and seasonality.
- Plotted observed, trend, seasonal, and residual components.

### Stationarity Checks:
- Conducted the **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)** test to assess stationarity.
- Applied differencing to transform non-stationary data into stationary for further analysis.

## Key Insights

### Regional Trends:
- Highly populated metro areas, such as New York and Los Angeles, dominate food consumption volumes.
- Smaller regions like Detroit and Philadelphia show preferences for specific food categories.

### Seasonal Patterns:
- **Winter**: Staples like milk and eggs peak due to holiday consumption.
- **Summer & Spring**: Alcohol and beverages see a boost in consumption.
- **Fall**: Packaged foods like frozen meals peak during back-to-school and stockpiling periods.

### Food-Specific Observations:
- Low-calorie beverages peak during warmer months in regions like Miami and Los Angeles.
- Alcohol consumption shows consistent demand with holiday peaks.

---

## Outputs
- Grouped bar charts for regional and seasonal purchase quantities.
- Decomposed time-series plots showing observed, trend, seasonal, and residual components.
- Stationarity results and plots for Auto-Correlation Function (ACF) and Partial Auto-Correlation Function (PACF).

## Applications

This seasonality analysis provides a foundation for:
- Developing time-series models for demand forecasting.
- Crafting regional and seasonal marketing strategies.
- Optimizing inventory to align with seasonal trends.

## Key Insights

### Significant Predictors:
- `Unit_value_mean_wtd` (price per 100 grams) is a crucial factor influencing demand.

### Price Elasticity Findings:
- **Staple Foods**: Inelastic demand (e.g., milk, eggs).
- **Luxury Items**: Elastic demand (e.g., alcohol).
